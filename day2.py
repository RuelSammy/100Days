terms: initialization, declaration and assignment of variables
Initialisation - refers to the assignment of an initial value for a variable or data object.
Declaration - a statement that specifies the properties of an identifier, such as a variable, function, 
            or constant
Assignment -  a statement that stores a value in a variable
Declaration – This is when you tell the compiler or interpreter that a variable exists, but you don’t necessarily give it a value yet.
c
int x;  // Declaring an integer variable named x
python
x = None  # Declaring a variable in Python (not required explicitly)
Assignment – This is when you give a value to a variable after it has been declared.
c
x = 10;  // Assigning 10 to x
python
x = 10  # Assigning 10 to x in Python
Initialization – This is when you declare and assign a value to a variable at the same time.

c
int y = 20;  // Declaration and initialization in C
python
y = 20  # Declaration and initialization in Python


difference between Dynamically typed and Statically typed variables
A dynamically typed language is a programming language that determines 
a variable's type at runtime, based on the variable's value. This means 
that the language doesn't require the programmer to specify the type of 
a variable before using it.
e.g - JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl, Objective-C, PHP, Lisp, and Tcl.

A statically typed language is a programming language that checks 
variable types during compilation, before the code runs. This allows 
for earlier error detection and more efficient code. 
e.g - Java, C,C++,Fortran,COBOL
