PYTHON Questions
1. How is it compiled?
Python is an interpreted language. Not a compiled one(Although there is some compilation going on)
Python code is intepreted line by line as byte code and then into machine language(1s and 0s) 
when you write a Python program, you’re essentially writing instructions in a high-level language
that you understand. This code is then compiled into byte code, an intermediary step to make execution 
easier. The Python interpreter reads the byte code, line by line, and acts on the instructions. 
Finally, the byte code is translated into machine language (0s and 1s) by lower-level system components, 
which is read by the computer’s transistors.

2. Python vs Java
a) Compilation vs Interpretation - Java is a compiled language while python is an interpreted language
b) Syntax - Java has a simpler syntax relative to C thus appearing easier. Python however doesn't have the requirements
            to have curly braces and closely resembles English making it easier to learn.
c) Performance - both Java and Python compile into bytecode and run on virtual machines allowing them to be 
                cross-platform python however is slower than Java.
d) Stability - Java is considered more stable than python. 
e) Security - Python edges out Java in terms of security.

3. Compiler vs Interpreter - compilers and interpreters both serve the purpose of converting high-level code into
 something a computer can understand, but they do so in different ways. A compiler translates the whole program at 
 once, which can make it run faster but takes more time to compile. An interpreter translates and runs the code 
 line by line, making it easier to catch errors and debug, though it may run slower.
